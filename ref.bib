abstract = {Electron microscopy is an indispensable tool for the characterization of (nano) materials. Electron microscopes are typically very expensive and their internal operation is often shielded from the user. This situation can provide fast and high quality results for researchers focusing on e.g. materials science if they have access to the relevant instruments. For researchers focusing on technique development, wishing to test novel setups, however, the high entry price can lead to risk aversion and deter researchers from innovating electron microscopy technology further. The closed attitude of commercial entities about how exactly the different parts of electron microscopes work, makes it even harder for newcomers in this field. Here we propose an affordable, easy-to-build electron detector for use in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The aim of this project is to shed light on the functioning of such detectors as well as show that even a very modest design can lead to acceptable performance while providing high flexibility for experimentation and customization.

abstract = {We propose a circuit that modulates a speech signal to a laser, using which the speech signal can be transmitted using the laser. Also, it shows the use of a platform based on embedded ARM (Advanced RISC Machine), running a small deep learning model based on TDNN (Time delay neural network) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), and converting speech to text, and use the text cipher for unlocking. This research implements a smart lock system that can set a pre-record speech cipher and verify the similarity through a laser transmission speech cipher to unlock it. In our experiment result, the English speech of laser transmission can reach a WER (Word error rate) of 14.06{\%} through the deep learning model to recognize the content of the speech cipher. We also design a similarity comparison algorithm based on LCS (Longest common subsequence) to compare the character set of the laser transmission speech compare and the prerecord speech cipher to calculate the similarity rate. Through the similarity comparison algorithm, when the WER is 27.27{\%}, the male speech samples used in this study still have a 95{\%} unlocking success rate, while the female speech samples have a 100{\%} unlocking success rate. Compared with only using automatic speech recognition (ASR) to unlock, the method we propose is to compare the similarity of the content of speech cipher. The method significantly improves the unlocking fault tolerance of using lasers to transmit audio. Therefore, by using the laser to transmit the speech cipher, the usability of the photoelectric smart lock system has been significantly improved. At the same time, the characteristics of the laser are not easy to eavesdrop on the cipher, which can also improve security.},

abstract = {Understanding light scattering and propagation in soymilk is crucial for the nondestructive evaluation of food qualities of soymilk and its products by near-infrared spectroscopy. We aim to numerically examine light scattering and propagation in soymilk samples with different solid-content properties (particle size distributions and concentrations) and medium sizes. Using the dependent scattering theory, we calculated the light-scattering properties of the samples on the sub-nanometer scale. In contrast, we calculated light propagation on the millimeter scale using the radiative transfer theory. Our numerical results show that the scattering properties of soymilk strongly depend on the solid-content properties, implying a high correlation between the solid-content and scattering properties. The sample with the largest mean diameter and broadest size distribution has the smallest reduced scattering coefficient among the samples, although it has the largest scattering coefficient. We compared the reflected fluence rates in a cylinder and semi-infinite medium. The comparative study shows the finite size effect on light propagation can be negligible at the cylinder radius of more than 2.0 cm. In that case, the light propagation model for a semi-infinite medium is a better choice to provide fast calculations in inverse analysis on the scattering properties. Our findings are essential for further developing near-infrared spectroscopy using scattered light and the physics of light scattering in dense polydisperse media.},

abstract = {The performance of nanoparticles is often affected by particle size and morphology. Currently, electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy is typically utilized to determine the size and morphology of nanoparticles. However, there are issues such as difficult sample preparation, long processing times, and challenges in quantitative characterization. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a fast, accurate, and statistical method to measure the size and morphology of nanoparticles. In this study, a new method, called polarized imaging dynamic light scattering (PIDLS), is proposed. The nanoparticles are irradiated with a vertical linearly polarized laser beam, and a polarization camera collected the dynamic light scattering images of particles at four different polarization directions (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°) at a scattering angle of 90°. The average particle size and distribution are obtained using the imaging dynamic light scattering method at 0° polarization direction, and the morphology of the particles is obtained based on the depolarization patterns of the scattered light. The optical sphericity Ф is defined based on the degree of linear polarization (DoLP). It is also implemented for the quantitative evaluation of the sphericity of the nanoparticles, including spherical, octahedral, nanoplate, nanorod, and linear ones. Together with the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere parameter $\psi$, the morphology of the nanoparticles can be roughly identified. In addition, PIDLS enables the measurement of particle size and morphology distributions simultaneously for evaluating the uniformity of particles. The effectiveness of PIDLS is verified by the measurement of five kinds of industrial titanium dioxide as well.},

abstract = {Color sensing is a technique for identifying physical changes in materials based on appearance assessment. Dirt deposition on solar panels can change their physical appearance and performance. Considering that dirt accumulation on solar panels needs monitoring to make efficient cleaning schedules, reduce unnecessary costs, and optimize solar panel output generation. Color sensing can achieve fast, accurate, and economical dirt detection, unlike the use of robotic cameras, mathematical formulae, and considering varying output current and voltage methods. Here, we introduce a method that detects and removes dirt on solar panels based on TCS3200 and Arduino Uno components. The approach targets (i.) Panel color measurement, calibration, threshold selection process, (ii.) comparison of color measurement values, and (iii.) align further calibration in response to discoloration of solar panels. This method aims to correct the dirt detection methods previously in use. Hence, a high-speed rolling brush arrangement is designed to improve the cleaning of the solar panel without using water. Further investigations of the panel's color may require some improvement in terms of increasing the sensitivity of the color sensor even with increased distance from the solar panel. Combining multiple color sensors may also be necessary.},

abstract = {Current polysaccharide conjugate vaccine manufacturing process involves conjugation of polysaccharide with protein followed by separation/purification of the conjugate from reaction components and free polysaccharide/protein, by preparative Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). Each SEC fraction is analyzed and pooled the conjugate based on its molar mass and absence of free polysaccharide. In the present work, we have evaluated in-line Multi Angle Light Scattering (MALS) as a Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tool to eliminate the need for offline analysis of individual fractions after purification. The preparatory SEC unit is coupled to a MALS detector, i.e. preparatory SEC-MALS. In SEC, the molecules are separated based on size, where polysaccharide-protein conjugate elutes first followed by free polysaccharide and then free protein. The MALS detector monitors in-line weight-average molar mass (Mw) during SEC-fractionation. Except the first fraction, the molar mass distribution data from in-line MALS enables decision on preparative SEC fractions to be pooled. We found that offline analysis of preparative fractions using analytical SEC-MALS was in good agreement with the {\textgreater}2000 kDa cutoff criterion. Thus in-line process analysis is effective, time-saving, and simple to implement in manufacturing processes of conjugate vaccines.},

This study reports on a low-cost immunoassay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 within 30 min using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The immunosensor comprises 50-nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, whose bioconjugation was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS). The specific binding of the bioconjugates to the spike protein led to an increase in bioconjugate size, with a limit of detection (LOD) 5.29 × 103 TCID50/mL (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose). The immunosensor was also proven to be selective upon interaction with influenza viruses once no increase in size was observed after DLS measurement. The strategy proposed here aimed to use antibodies conjugated to AuNPs as a generic platform that can be extended to other detection principles, enabling technologies for low-cost mass testing for COVID-19.},

abstract = {The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for several steps of the viral life cycle, and is abundantly expressed during infection, making it an ideal diagnostic target protein. This protein has a strong tendency for dimerization and interaction with nucleic acids. For the first time, high titers of NP were expressed in E. coli with a CASPON tag, using a growth-decoupled protein expression system. Purification was accomplished by nuclease treatment of the cell homogenate and a sequence of downstream processing (DSP) steps. An analytical method consisting of native hydrophobic interaction chromatography hyphenated to multi-angle light scattering detection (HIC-MALS) was established for in-process control, in particular, to monitor product fragmentation and multimerization throughout the purification process. 730 mg purified NP per liter of fermentation could be produced by the optimized process, corresponding to a yield of 77{\%} after cell lysis. The HIC-MALS method was used to demonstrate that the NP product can be produced with a purity of 95{\%}. The molecular mass of the main NP fraction is consistent with dimerized protein as was verified by a complementary native size-exclusion separation (SEC)-MALS analysis. Peptide mapping mass spectrometry and host cell specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the high product purity, and the presence of a minor endogenous chaperone explained the residual impurities. The optimized HIC-MALS method enables monitoring of the product purity, and simultaneously access its molecular mass, providing orthogonal information complementary to established SEC-MALS methods. Enhanced resolving power can be achieved over SEC, attributed to the extended variables to tune selectivity in HIC mode.},

The resulting interest in and use of light scattering methods suggests the need for an easily understood introduction and review of material for those new to the method as well as for current users in need of a refresher. In many respects, the theory and its applications may appear so overwhelming for many studying the field for the first time, that they rarely can spend the time just needed to understand the basic measurements and their interpretations. A variety of applications in analytical chemistry especially have resulted in a greater understanding of many of the macromolecular processes themselves from molar mass distributions, to the macromolecular interactions responsible for aggregation processes, to determinations of structure and function. The use of such analytical processes to obtain a better understanding of nanoparticle structure and function has become almost universal.},

LEDs can serve as either light emitters or detectors, thus being an alternative to the most popular detection systems consisted of PD. In this contribution, a comparison between LED-LED and LED-PD detectors, operating in turbidimetric and nephelometric modes, has been carried out for immunoprecipitation detection of transferrin and ferritin. The greatest emphasis was placed on the study of detectors responses under different measurement conditions including current powering an emitter, amplification gain in the case of PD as detector or the construction of detection cells designed for the Multicommutated Flow Analysis (MCFA). The assumption was to obtain the fully-mechanized system with simple but efficient detection system to enable the determination of iron-binding proteins occurring at different concentration ranges in human body. As a result, the optimized arrangements of LED-LED and LED-PD setups were characterized by similar analytical characteristics, enabling the determination of transferrin with the detection limit (LOD) of 0.2 mg/L and RSDs of 2.8–4.8{\%} for LED-LED, and LOD of 0.1 mg/L and RSDs of 0.9–3.6{\%} for LED-PD. In the case of ferritin detection, only the response of the LED-PD detector was statistically distinguishable in the range of 130–198 $\mu$g/L of protein with recorded analytical signal change of 20 mV value. The addition of polymer for signal enhancement provided the increase of response range to 107–253 $\mu$g/L, enabling the developed system for detection of pathological serum ferritin levels.},

In this paper, the precipitant was mixed directly to the solution of sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) in contrast to the conventional dropwise technique which prevented a high production rate. The dropwise of HCl was carried out to know the effect of pH at two different temperature 25 °C (T20) and 80 °C (T80) on the obtained particles. It was obtained that the optimized process was at temperature 25 C. Subsequently, the mixing technique of HCl (conventional dropwise and direct mixing) were investigated at temperature 25 °C. The result showed that direct mixing technique resulted in high production rate with acceptable size and dispersion of silica nanoparticles. It is also highlighted that the proposed direct mixing technique of HCl received a simple and faster-precipitated process in large scale production. Therefore, it is proposed that for the scale-up production of silica nanoparticle by precipitation of the sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) precursor with additional of HCl may be prepared by direct mixing method at pH 7 in temperature 25°C.},

abstract = {Dynamic light scattering (DLS), also known as photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), is a very powerful tool for studying the diffusion behaviour of macromolecules in solution. The diffusion coefficient, and hence the hydrodynamic radii calculated from it, depends on the size and shape of macromolecules. In this review, we provide evidence of the usefulness of DLS to study the homogeneity of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes of protein–protein or protein–nucleic acid preparations, as well as to study protein–small molecule interactions. Further, we provide examples of DLS's application both as a complementary method to analytical ultracentrifugation studies and as a screening tool to validate solution scattering models using determined hydrodynamic radii.},

We present a model experiment in a micro-channel to study flowing Brownian motion systems of polystyrene latex particles by using Image Dynamic Light Scattering method (IDLS). The modified correlation function proposed by Chowdhury et al, which is applied to the analysis of extracting the size and velocity of laminar flowing particulate dispersions, is used in the paper to obtain the particle size from the scattered light signals. The new method allows for much shorter measurement time compared to conventional DLS. As the inversion algorithm of polydisperse system is yet very complex, the measurement of the paper is for monodisperse polystyrene latex particles.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles represent promising carriers for controlled drug delivery. This work focuses on the size and molecular mass characterization of polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles formed by anionic emulsion polymerization of butylcyanoacrylate in the presence of poloxamer 188 as a stabilizer. Three different methods were used to determine the size and size distribution of the particle populations: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and analytical ultracentrifugation (ANUC). SEM on freeze-dried and Au-shadowed samples showed a relatively narrow distribution of virtually spherical particles with a mean diameter of 167 nm. DLS yielded a monomodal distribution with hydrodynamic diameters around 199 nm (in the absence of additional stabilizer) or 184 nm (in the presence of 1{\%} poloxamer 188). The size distribution determined by ANUC using sedimentation velocity analysis was somewhat more complex, the size of the most abundant particles being around 184 nm. Molar particle mass distributions centered around 2.3×109 g/mol. The advantages and disadvantages of the three sizing techniques are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@techreport{Pecora2000,
abstract = {Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques for studying sizes and shapes of nanoparticles in liquids are reviewed. In photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), the time fluctuations in the intensity of light scattered by the particle dispersion are monitored. For dilute dispersions of spherical nanoparticles, the decay rate of the time autocorrelation function of these intensity fluctuations is used to directly measure the particle translational diffusion coefficient, which is in turn related to the particle hydrodynamic radius. For a spherical particle, the hydrodynamic radius is essentially the same as the geometric particle radius (including any possible solvation layers). PCS is one of the most commonly used methods for measuring radii of submicron size particles in liquid dispersions. Depolarized Fabry-Perot interferometry (FPI) is a less common dynamic light scattering technique that is applicable to optically anisotropic nanoparticles. In FPI the frequency broadening of laser light scattered by the particles is analyzed. This broadening is proportional to the particle rotational diffusion coefficient, which is in turn related to the particle dimensions. The translational diffusion coefficient measured by PCS and the rotational diffusion coefficient measured by depolarized FPI may be combined to obtain the dimensions of non-spherical particles. DLS studies of liquid dispersions of nanometer-sized oligonucleotides in a water-based buffer are used as examples.},

The scattering equations that relate the scattered intensity autocorrelation to the particle position correlation function are derived. This technique has potential applications for measurement of biomolecular force constants and probing viscoelastic properties of complex media.},
